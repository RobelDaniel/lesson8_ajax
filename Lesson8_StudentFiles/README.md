### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. (I learned about the API keys and how it allows you to have access to certain information. In this case, it allowed me to have access to the TMDB movie database and without it I wouldnt be able to link my application with the movie database.)
2. (I learned that ajax makes it possible for your page to be updated with information and not have to refresh the page or load a new one. The information is updated directly to that same page.)
3. (I learned that json was able to receive the information from the database server then convert it into the format that already exists in my application, so that it is in the same format as the rest of the information.)
